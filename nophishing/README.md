# No Phishing: Detecting Malicious URLs
#### DSBA 5122 - Summer 2024 - Neal Logan

## Overview

This project is aimed at developing effective models for detecting phishing URLs, beginning with a labelled dataset containing both raw URLs and numerous extacted features, based on the URLs themselves, the pages they target, and third-party information about the sites.

## Reproducing Results

The results can be reproduced by simply running the notebook [02 Modeling](https://github.com/neal-logan/dsba6211-summer2024/blob/main/nophishing/02_modeling.ipynb).  This notebook will install and import the necessary packages of the correct versions, load and transform the [data](https://github.com/neal-logan/dsba6211-summer2024/tree/main/nophishing/data), run and evaluate the models, and finally explain key features of the models and the data itself.  The random seed is embedded in the notebook and used wherever necessary to obtain consistent results.
