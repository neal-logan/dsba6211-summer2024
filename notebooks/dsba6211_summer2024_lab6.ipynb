The year 1920 is not the carefree era she had imagined, but rather a time of great hardship and suffering. \n\nDetermined to find out what went wrong, Amelia sets out to uncover the truth behind this alternate version of history. Along the way, she meets a group of rebels who are fighting against the oppressive government that has taken control of the timeline. \n\nAs Amelia delves deeper into the mystery, she discovers that the Time Travel Corporation has been manipulating the past for their own gain, altering events to suit their own agenda. With the help of the rebels, Amelia must find a way to restore the timeline to its original state"

A team of archaeologists and historians are tasked with traveling back in time to ancient Egypt to uncover the mysteries of the pyramids. However, during their expedition, they accidentally disrupt a crucial event in history, causing a ripple effect that alters the course of civilization.\n\nAs they struggle to repair the damage they've done, they realize that their actions have unleashed a dangerous force that threatens to unravel the fabric of time itself. The team must race against the clock to fix their mistake and restore the timeline before it's too late.\n\nBut as they delve deeper into the secrets of the past, they uncover a shocking truth about the origins of time travel and the dark forces that seek to control it. With the fate of the world hanging in the balance, the team must make a desperate decision that will test their loyalty, bravery, and belief in the power of humanity.\n\nUltimately, they must confront their own inner demons and fears as they navigate a treacherous journey through time and space, facing enemies both ancient and modern. Will they be able to set things right and save the future, or will they be doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past?"
