However, there is a catch - once someone travels back in time, they cannot return to their original timeline. \n\nDr. Jones decides to test the time machine herself and travels back to the year 1920, where she becomes entangled in a dangerous conspiracy involving a group of time travelers who are trying to alter the course of history for their own gain. As Dr. Jones races against time to stop them, she discovers that the consequences of changing the past are far more devastating than she could have ever imagined.\n\nAs Dr. Jones navigates through different time periods, she begins to uncover the true purpose of the time machine and the dark secrets that lie within it. With the help of a ragtag group of allies from different eras, Dr. Jones must confront her own past mistakes and make the ultimate sacrifice to save the future from being irrevocably altered.\n\nThrough twists and turns, betrayals and alliances, Dr. Jones must navigate the complexities of time travel and ultimately learn that the true power of the time machine lies not in changing the past, but in shaping the future for the better"

Excited for the adventure, Aurora boards the time machine and is transported back in time.\n\nHowever, when she arrives in ancient Egypt, Aurora quickly realizes that something is wrong. The pyramid is not being built as it should be, and the workers are in a state of panic. As she investigates further, Aurora discovers that a group of rogue time travelers has been altering the past, causing chaos and changing the course of history.\n\nDetermined to set things right, Aurora teams up with a group of rebels from ancient Egypt and embarks on a dangerous journey through time to stop the rogue time travelers and restore the timeline.
